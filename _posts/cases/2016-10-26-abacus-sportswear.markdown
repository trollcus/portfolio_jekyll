<h3>General notes</h3>
I was responsible for all the digital material that was released during the time I helped Abacus. They were in a position of not having anyone at their marketing team which meant that they reached out to me and asked me if I could help them to transition and improve their ways of doing things in their marketing department. This meant increasing overall efficiency. This meant reducing cost when creating their workbook which is released for each collection which means two per year. Previously they had people working on it nonstop for a month. Instead of doing this and with the help of my technical sense I managed to push this down to one week from zero to completion. I also helped them with providing modern tools to schedule and analyse social media, created prepared forms for their team of salesmen to be able to hand out to customers and consulted in the preparation of creating an ecommerce site. With time I will update this entry as I get a hold of more material and prepare it to be published. With the help of my good friend <a href="https://www.fotografvictor.com/">Victor</a> he has agreed to assist in helping me photograph the print section.
<h3>Digital design</h3>
Multiple times I was asked to create ads on a very limited timeframe. These were often very spontaneous but had to align to the current collection of clothes. Below you will find some samples. These are created with HTML5, CSS and JS.
