We were asked to create a media campaign for a specific artist. My group got Kanye West and we were supposed to create two memes, album art and a music video. In this post I'm going to write about the music video.

The time we had for developing the music video was three weeks.

My responsibilities during this project was art direction and directing the video + edit. The other two people in my group were responsible for drawing and animating the illustrated Kanye.

__Tools used:__ Adobe Photoshop, After effects, Premiere Pro and Character animator

<h3>Introduction</h3>
During the first phase of the project the group brainstormed over different songs to produce a music video for. We wanted it to be coherent with the digital campaign that was to be produced after the video was completed. We went over a bunch of Kanye West's songs to see which song could be fitting. Amongst these were _'Welcome to the heartbreak', 'POWER', 'All of the lights' and 'Lost in the world'_. All of these songs had strong messages and we wanted it to align with what Kanye was doing at this time (late 2018). His last album was a lot about therapy for himself, he talked about how he wanted his daughter to grow up to be a monster a.k.a a strong woman who does not take shit from anyone. Kanye often also references his mother throughout the years, even dedicating a song on the album _'Late Registration'_ called _'Hey Mama'_. He never dropped a music video for this though. With this in hand we decided to promote strong women in the world, in particular strong mothers.

<h3>Hey Mama</h3>
We knew that we wanted to portray these mothers in a respectful way. We talked about illustrating them and creating sequences. However we wanted the viewer to recognize important moments in time and experience the love that one can feel for ones mother. We decided to take iconic mothers throughout history and display these during the chorus. The mothers were amongst others: Forrest Gump's mother, Jackie Kennedy, Princess Diana.  

We wanted to incorporate Kanye's own story in a more abstract way. It was done via illustrations. We drew inspiration from one of Kanye's collaborators Takashi Murakami that has drawn Kanye's album covers before and drawing the famous bear.

We wanted simple illustrations filled with color and detailed illustrations of where we wanted the viewer to focus on.

<h3>Reflection</h3>
Great project and had a lot of fun doing it. It allowed me to do a lot of After effects and Premiere Pro for edit and creating special effects for the video. It also allowed us to push ourselves to create something creative within a short timespan.
